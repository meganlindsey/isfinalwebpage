        <p> My name is Megan Lindsey (Robinson). I am from Springville, UT, a smallish town tucked away between Provo and Spanish Fork. I am the oldest of five kids, 2 girls and 3 boys. I graduated from Springville High School in 2016. After graduation, I moved to St. George, Utah and attended Dixie State University for two years. After finishing at Dixie, I got an internship working in Key West, FL. I lived there for six months and loved living an island lifestyle. I transferred to UVU from Dixie after I moved home from paradise. I was in my second semester there when I decided to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was called to serve in the Texas San Antonio Mission. While I was on my mission I decided to transfer schools again, this time to BYU. I returned home from my mission in February of 2022 and immediately started dating my now husband (who I met while I was in Texas). We got married in November and life these past 6 months has been everthing I had ever hoped it would be. :)) <br>
        I love my family, I love my husband, I love Harry Potter, I love being outdoors, and I love the sun!   </p>
